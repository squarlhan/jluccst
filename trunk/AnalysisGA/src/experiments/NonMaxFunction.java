  /**
   * This example implementation calculates the fitness value of Chromosomes
   * using BooleanAllele implementations. It simply returns a fitness value
   * equal to the numeric binary value of the bits. In other words, it
   * optimizes the numeric value of the genes interpreted as bits. It should
   * be noted that, for clarity, this function literally returns the binary
   * value of the Chromosome's genes interpreted as bits. However, it would
   * be better to return the value raised to a fixed power to exaggerate the
   * difference between the higher values. For example, the difference
   * between 254 and 255 is only about .04%, which isn't much incentive for
   * the selector to choose 255 over 254. However, if you square the values,
   * you then get 64516 and 65025, which is a difference of 0.8% -- twice
   * as much and, therefore, twice the incentive to select the higher
   * value.
   *
